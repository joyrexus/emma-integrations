# Emma Integrations

We at Emma are in the process of setting up a new Integrations Engineering
Team.  Most of us are new to the company, still getting oriented.  This is an initial attempt at an overview of Emma's current integration landscape along with some suggestions for future integration tasks.

There seem to be two principal resources for developing third-party integrations with Emma, viz., Emma's [Public API](api.md) as well as an internally available [Integration Service](service.md).  A hapi-service serving as a front-end to Emma's [ElasticSearch cluster](elasticsearch.md) may serve as another option.

See the [projects](projects.md) page for our initial project ideas.
