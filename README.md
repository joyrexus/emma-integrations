# Emma Integrations

We at Emma are in the process of setting up a new Integrations Engineering
Team.  Most of us are new to the company, still getting oriented.  This is an initial attempt at an overview of Emma's current integration landscape along with some suggestions for future integration tasks.

Emma has two principle resources for developing third-party integrations, viz., Emma's [Public API](emma-api.md) as well as an internally available [eda-integrations](service.md) framework. The latter is an event-driven service for developing partner integrations that involve contact importing/syncing.  It provides end-user frontend support (called "Audience Connect") for setting up third-party service connections, mapping externally defined groups to internally defined groups, and mapping externally defined contact fields to internally defined contact fields.
