# Public API

> See also Emma's internally available [Integration Service](service.md).

Emmaâ€™s platform is accessible through a public API. This is a JSON/REST API that enables clients to manage member mailing lists and access mailing response data.

In particular, the API enables clients to ...

* import, edit, and delete members
* organize members into groups
* search for members
* retrieve past mailings
* control status of pending mailings
* access mailing response info (opens, clicks, shares, opt-outs)

The API contains [endpoints for the following resources](http://api.myemma.com/index.html#api-calls-by-category):

* fields
* groups
* mailings
* members
* response
* searches
* signup forms
* triggers
* webhooks

The API also provides notifications via webhooks for the following mailing response events:

* member ...
  * signup
  * optout

* message ...
  * open
  * click
  * share
  * share click
  * forward

It also provides notifications for the following account-level events:

* mailing finish
* import finish
* member ...
  * create / update / delete
  * add to group
  * remove from group
  * status update
* group create / update / delete
* field create / update / delete

[This document](http://api.myemma.com/api/external/webhooks.html) describes how to activate webhook notifications for a particular account.

 
#### Integration Service

See the [`eda-integrations`](https://github.com/emmadev/eda-integrations) repo. Emma's Integration Service consists of a [hapi](http://hapijs.com)-based http server as well as a few python-based event-driven handlers. The service can be used for contact syncing, event notification via webhooks, and serving up content blocks to Emma's frontend editor.

For an overview of the service and a description of how to use it for contact syncing, see [this document](https://github.com/emmadev/eda-integrations/blob/master/docs/ac-overview.md).
