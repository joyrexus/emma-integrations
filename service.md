# Integration Service

See the [`eda-integrations`](https://github.com/emmadev/eda-integrations) repo. Emma's Integration Service consists of a [hapi](http://hapijs.com)-based http server as well as a few python-based event-driven handlers. The service can be used for contact syncing, event notification via webhooks, and serving up content blocks to Emma's frontend editor.

For an overview of the service and a description of how to use it for contact syncing, see [this document](https://github.com/emmadev/eda-integrations/blob/master/docs/ac-overview.md).

An overview of the service from an internal perspective is available [here](https://myemma.atlassian.net/wiki/display/INT/Integrations+Service) and [here](https://myemma.atlassian.net/wiki/display/INT/Contact+Syncing+MVP).
